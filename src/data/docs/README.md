# Welcome alpha testers!

If you want to help alpha test Unison, you are in the right place. This document gives a quick project status update and rough roadmap for future work, so you have some idea of what to expect.

## What's in this release?

This alpha release is mostly focused on the core Unison language and its tooling. There's not much in the way of libraries yet. With this release, you should be able to to write new Unison code using other Unison libraries and publish new code yourself. The tools you'll use for this are just your preferred text editor and the _Unison Codebase Manager_. The codebase manager is an all-in-one tool you'll get to know well that handles everything other than text editing related to working with Unison code: typechecking it, running it, browsing the codebase, refactoring, publishing, and so on.

## What's next?

* See the [install and quickstart guide](/docs/quickstart) to get going.
