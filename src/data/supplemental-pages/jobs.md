# Jobs at Unison Computing

Unison Computing is a seed stage startup and a [public benefit corp](/2020/03/30/benefit-corp-report/). You can read more about the company's background and our mission [in this post](/2020/03/30/benefit-corp-report/). See the [Unison Strange Loop talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCWtkvDQ2ZI) for an introduction to the core ideas behind Unison and also [the Unison documentation site](https://unisonweb.org/docs) for more about the Unison language.

# Infrastructure Engineer

We are looking for an Infrastructure Engineer to help build a futuristic platform for distributed computing in the Unison language. Unison programs can describe whole distributed systems (see [the Strange Loop talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCWtkvDQ2ZI) to learn more about Unison), and you'll be building a platform that supports distributed execution of these programs on fully managed infrastructure. We're passionate about making distributed computing simpler and more accessible to everyone, so not everyone needs to have on hand DevOps or infrastructure experts just to create and run distributed programs.

You'd be joining a very small team and would have an active role in helping determine what we build next and how we build it. You will be part of a team which owns the Unison Cloud effort, but you'll also get to use Unison to build distributed programs and you'll work on core open source Unison libraries to support your work.

### Important traits for this role

You should be someone with hands on experience working with distributed systems. Likely you've worked with major cloud providers before such as AWS, GCP, etc., and are familiar with distributed computing platforms such as Spark, Kubernetes, Hadoop, etc.

We love statically-typed functional languages such as Elm, PureScript, Scala, Haskell, and Unison itself. We hope that you'll be excited to learn about them if you haven't already.

We're committed to building a friendly, welcoming, and diverse community of Unison programmers, and it's important to us that you commit to this as well.

And probably the most important trait for this role is: enthusiasm for making computing better, a belief that the (computing) world is what we make of it, and an ability and willingness to learn whatever is necessary to make a new vision of computing a reality. Regardless of your past experience, you will often find yourself in uncharted territory. We think that's awesome and part of the fun and hope you do as well!

### Logistics

We are based in [Somerville, MA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Square), but we have employees in other parts of the US, and we are comfortably working remotely. (And, since COVID, we have all been working from home.) Although we ask that some working hours overlap with a 9-5 [EDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/edt) work day, we also recognize that our team members are also parents, hobbyists, family members, and community members, and we are happy that our flexibility allows us to flourish both professionally and personally.

The company offers competitive benefits, paid parental leave, and a vacation policy that emphasizes work/life balance.

### How to apply

Send an email to jobs@unison.cloud. Here's what to include:

- Tell us who you are and why you want to work on Unison.
- Include your résumé/CV or a link to it (LinkedIn is fine).
- If you have any examples of work you've done, publications you've made, talks you've given, articles or blog posts you've written, or anything else you want to share with us, we'd love to see!
- Let us know where you are currently based.
- What questions do you have about the role?

We look forward to hearing from you!
