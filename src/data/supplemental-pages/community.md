# Community

Welcome! Here are some of the places where folks discuss Unison:

* The [Unison Slack][slack] is pretty active.
* There's a [Boston Unison meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Unison/) that meets semi-regularly.  
* There's a [Boston Unison developers group](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/wiki/Boston-Unison-Developers-meetup-notes) for folks in the Boston area interested in helping to build Unison. See the [#bostonunisondevs channel on Slack][slack] if you're in the Boston area and would like to participate.
* Development happens on [the Unison GitHub repo](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/), and there's also regular discussion in the [#contrib channel on Slack][slack].

We want these to be welcoming and enjoyable spaces for everyone. The [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) outlines expectations for participants.
