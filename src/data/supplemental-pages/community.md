# Community

Welcome! Here are some of the places where folks discuss Unison:

* The [Unison Slack](/slack) is pretty active.  (Please join with your full name so we know who weâ€™re talking to, and to reduce the chance of collision.)
* The [Calendar](/calendar) has upcoming Unison events. If you have a Unison-related event you'd like listed there, you can mention it in [#general of Slack](/slack).
* There's a [Boston Unison meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Unison/) that meets semi-regularly.  
* There's a [Boston Unison developers group](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/wiki/Boston-Unison-Developers-meetup-notes) for folks in the Boston area interested in helping to build Unison. See the [#bostonunisondevs channel on Slack](/slack) if you're in the Boston area and would like to participate.
* Development happens on [the Unison GitHub repo](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/), and there's also regular discussion in the [#contrib channel on Slack](/slack).

We want these to be welcoming and enjoyable spaces for everyone. The [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) outlines expectations for participants.
