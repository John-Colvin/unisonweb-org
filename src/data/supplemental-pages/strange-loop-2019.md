# Hello, Strange Loop attendees!

We will be [presenting at Strange Loop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2019/unison-a-new-distributed-programming-language.html) this year and having an informal after-party on Saturday evening, location TBD. We'll post updated details here and on the [#unison Strange Loop channel](https://strangeloop2019.slack.com), and will also announce meeting spot at the end of the talk on Saturday.

Looking forward to meeting folks in person!

_Paul and Arya_
