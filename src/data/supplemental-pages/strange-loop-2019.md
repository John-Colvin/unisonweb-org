# Hello, Strange Loop attendees!

We will be [presenting at Strange Loop](https://www.thestrangeloop.com/2019/unison-a-new-distributed-programming-language.html) this year and having an informal after-party on Saturday evening, at [The Sliced Pint](http://www.theslicedpint.com/) at 6pm. We hope to see you there, you can [RSVP on the #unison Strange Loop channel](https://strangeloop2019.slack.com/archives/CMZBHMT8V/p1568412215016500) and will also post any updated details there.

Looking forward to meeting folks in person!
