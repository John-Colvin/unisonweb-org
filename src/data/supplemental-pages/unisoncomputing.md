# About Unison Computing

Unison Computing is a [public benefit corp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-benefit_corporation), cofounded by Paul Chiusano, RÃºnar Bjarnason, and Arya Irani. We work alongside other [amazing open source contributors](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.markdown) on the Unison language. ðŸ’œ

Our overall mission: advance what's possible with software and work to make software creation simpler and more accessible to all. The company does research and development into new, free, open source software technologies like Unison, and works on useful products and services (like [the Unison Cloud Platform](http://unison.cloud) that will (someday, we hope) make money atop these free technologies. As a public benefit corp, we view the business side of our work as a means of capitalizing this larger mission of developing better software creation tools.

If you have questions about the company, feel free to get in touch with one of us individually us [on Slack](/community).
