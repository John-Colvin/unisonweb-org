# About Unison Computing

Unison Computing is a [public benefit corp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-benefit_corporation), cofounded by Paul Chiusano, RÃºnar Bjarnason, and Arya Irani. We work alongside other amazing open source contributors on the Unison language. ðŸ’œ

Our overall mission: advance what's possible with software and work to make software creation simpler and more accessible to all. The company does research and development of new, open source software technologies like Unison and works on useful products and services that will (someday, we hope) make money atop these technologies (like [the Unison Cloud Platform](http://unison.cloud)). As a public benefit corp, we see the business and products side of our work as a means of capitalizing this larger mission of developing better software creation tools.

If you have questions about the company [feel free to get in touch with one of us individually us on Slack](/community).
