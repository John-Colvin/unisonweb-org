  blurb: |
    Unison is an open source functional programming language based on a simple idea with big implications: code in Unison is content-addressed, identified by a hash of its syntax tree. Read on for more.

intro: |
  Unison uses this simple idea of content-addressed code to rebuild and improve on many aspects of how a programming language works. We simplify codebase management (Unison has no builds, no dependency conflicts, instant renames, and more). And the same core idea forms the basis for a runtime that robustly supports dynamic code deployment, allowing a single Unison program to describe entire elastic distributed systems.

  Though a lot of the work on Unison is still experimental and ongoing, we're sharing an early release of the language for people to test out. We'll be making a release more generally available soon anyone is welcome to [help with alpha testing](/docs).
