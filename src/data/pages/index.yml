  blurb: |
    Unison is an open source functional programming language based on a simple idea with big implications: code in Unison is content-addressed, identified by a hash of its syntax tree. See below for more.

intro: |
  It may not seem like much, but the simple idea of content-addressed code affects almost every aspect of how a programming language works. It is used to simplify codebase management (Unison has no builds, has code sharing without dependency conflicts, instant renames, and more). And the same core idea forms the basis for a runtime that robustly supports dynamic code deployment, allowing a single Unison program to describe entire elastic distributed systems.

  Though a lot of the work on Unison is still experimental and ongoing, we're sharing an early release of the language for people to test out. We'll be making a release more generally available soon but if you'd like to help participate in alpha testing, go to [the docs site](/docs).
